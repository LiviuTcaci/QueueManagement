# QueueManagement
This project implements a Queue Management Application in Java, emphasizing multithreading and synchronization. It simulates a queue system, like in customer service, where multiple threads represent customers at different service counters. The goal is to demonstrate effective concurrency management and ensure thread-safe operations.
